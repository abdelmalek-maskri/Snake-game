# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, created using Python's Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls a snake that grows in length for each piece of food it eats, and the game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
- Try to eat the blue food that appears randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the game speeds up.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Smooth snake movement
- Collision detection with food, walls, and the snake itself
- Score tracking and display
- Game over scenario and restart ability
